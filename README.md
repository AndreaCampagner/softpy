# Fuzzy Systems and Evolutionary Computing
## Laboratory Course

This is the GitHub repository for the Laboratory class of the Fuzzy Systems and Evolutionary Computing course, offered
at the 2nd year of the Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence at University of Milano-Bicocca.

The aim of the course is to provide a practical introduction to the main notions in, and applications of, fuzzy systems and evolutionary computing.
The course adopts an hands-on, laboratory teaching approach where students are taught theoretical topics (already seen at lesson) by 
exploration and selected re-implementation of parts of a library (purposedly developed for the course, but built to be usable in real-world), and by
solving selected tasks and problems in an interactive and collaborative manner (using Jupyter notebooks).

**Instructor Name**: Andrea Campagner (PhD)
**Instructor Affiliation**: Post-Doc Researcher at IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Milan, Italy
